# WethearUpdate
A simple web application that gives current weather information and weather forecast for upcoming 2 weeks.
I have used several apis in this.
Open Weather Map and Visual Crossing Weather from Rapid Api were used for weather information.
Open Street Map api used for suggestions for locations. It is slow but it has wide range of results.
To login the page use "user@guest.com" as E-mail and "guestUser" as password.
